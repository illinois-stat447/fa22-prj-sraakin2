In this project, we'll mainly be exploring the COVID-19 cases that had occurred in UIUC from August 2020 - November 2022. We'll be using the dataset that comes from the Illinois Shield Testing Data website, which tracks and records all cases, tests, and vaccinations taken for each groups of people. These groups of people include undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty / staff members. We'll explore the data by creating visualiztions models of each group to see their number of cases, tests, vaccination rate and positivity rate. This will mostly be a visual interactive app made from RShiny.
